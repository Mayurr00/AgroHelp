      "cause": " Nitrogen is a critical component of chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for photosynthesis. It is also an essential building block of proteins, DNA, and RNA. A lack of nitrogen can result in stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor plant quality. Nitrogen is often the most limiting nutrient in agricultural soils, and it is typically supplied to plants in the form of fertilizer."

      "cause": "Phosphorus is an essential component of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that provides energy for cellular processes. It is also a crucial element in the formation of nucleic acids, phospholipids, and several other organic molecules. Plants deficient in phosphorus exhibit stunted growth, reduced root development, and often have poor flowering and fruiting."

It also helps plants to tolerate stress by improving water use efficiency and enhancing disease resistance. A deficiency in potassium can lead to reduced growth, wilting, and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases."
